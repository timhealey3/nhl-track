# NHL Track

A real-time NHL game tracker that scrapes live game data and displays live game scores.

## Why

I have never done webscraping with javascript before and I wanted to give it a try. I have also heard a lot about Deno. And wanted to try building a project with it.

## Dependencies

- **axios**: HTTP client for web scraping
- **cheerio**: Server-side jQuery implementation for HTML parsing
- **js-yaml**: YAML configuration file parser
- **puppeteer**: Web scraping and automation (if needed)

## Configuration

The app reads game URLs from `Application.yml` configuration file.
